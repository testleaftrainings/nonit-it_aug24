#### What is a Window Handle?
- A Window Handle is a unique identifier, a string, that Selenium WebDriver assigns to each open window or tab. It acts much like a unique address for a house, allowing WebDriver to navigate to and control a specific window.

#### Why Window Handles are Important
- Web applications can open multiple windows or tabs. 
- To perform actions on elements within these windows, Selenium needs to know which window to interact with. - - Window handles enable this by providing a unique ID for each window.

#### How to Handle Windows
- To handle windows, WebDriver provides two methods:
  - `getWindowHandle()`: Retrieves the ID of the current window.
  - `getWindowHandles()`: Retrieves a set of all open windows' IDs.
- To switch to a different window, the syntax is `driver.switchTo().window(windowHandle);` where `windowHandle` is the unique identifier of the target window.

#### Handling Multiple Windows
1. Retrieve the set of window handles using `driver.getWindowHandles()`.
2. Convert the set to a list to handle windows in a sequential manner.
3. Use the `driver.switchTo().window(windowHandle)` to switch control to the desired window.
4. After operations are completed, windows can be closed using `driver.close()`, and control can be switched back to the main window.

### NoSuchWindowException:
 - `NoSuchWindowException` is an exception which signifies that the action you are trying to perform cannot be completed because the window or tab you are referencing no longer exists or is inaccessible. This can happen for various reasons:
1. **Window or Tab Closed:** If the script attempts to interact with a window or tab that has been closed.
2. **Switched Context:** If the script has switched to a different window or frame, and attempts to interact with the original window without switching back.
To handle this exception, you can:
- Verify that the window or tab you are trying to interact with is open and accessible.
- Ensure that your script correctly switches to the window or tab before interacting with it.
